Hello! My name is Petra Đurić and I have just become an undergradute student in the Faculty of Biology at the University of Belgrade. 
Currently I'm at the beginning of my journey in the world of programming, learning the basics of python, with the goal to, one day,
apply that knowledge to create programs based on bioinformatics algorithms and mathemathical models of biological systems.
